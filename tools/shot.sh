# Screenshot a page with headless Chrome.
#
# Two things this has to work around, both learned the hard way:
#
#   * Chrome 136+ IGNORES the automation flags when they would touch the real profile, so
#     every run gets a throwaway --user-data-dir. Without it the browser silently starts with
#     the developer's own profile and extensions, and the screenshot is of a page nobody else
#     will ever see.
#   * `--screenshot` writes the file and then sometimes does not exit. The watchdog below
#     waits for the file rather than for the process, which is the thing actually wanted.
#     macOS has no `timeout(1)`, so this is spelled out rather than delegated.
#   * A PAGE WHOSE ASSETS LIVE ON ANOTHER ORIGIN renders without them, and says nothing. The
#     local WordPress has `siteurl` of http://localhost:8099, so it writes its script and font
#     URLs against `localhost`. Ask for the same page on `127.0.0.1` and every module script
#     and every font is a cross-origin fetch that CORS refuses: no JavaScript at all, and the
#     type falls back. `getComputedStyle` still answers "Literata" on both, because a computed
#     font-family is what was asked for and not what arrived - the honest measurement is
#     `document.fonts`, which reported `Literata:loaded` on localhost and `Literata:error` on
#     127.0.0.1. Weeks of screenshots in this repository were taken that way and the fallback
#     is close enough to the real face that nobody looked twice. Below, the requested origin is
#     compared against the origins the page's own scripts and stylesheets point at.
#   * headless=new opens a real window, and the window has an OS MINIMUM WIDTH. Ask for 390
#     and Chrome lays the page out at 500 and hands back the left 390 pixels of it, with no
#     warning and a file of exactly the size requested. Measured: 480, 460, 420 and 390 all
#     reproduce the 500px render line for line, with the header icons sliced by the right
#     edge; 500 and 600 wrap differently from each other and from all of them. Every phone
#     screenshot taken with this script before that was measured was a desktop page cropped,
#     which is worse than no screenshot - it invents overflow that is not there. Below the
#     floor this now REFUSES. Phone widths are checked in the browser pane, which emulates
#     the device rather than shrinking a window.
#
# Usage: shot.sh <url> <out.png> [width] [height]
